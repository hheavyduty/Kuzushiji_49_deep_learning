# Kuzushiji_49_deep_learning
Kuzushiji-49, as the name suggests, has 49 classes (28x28 grayscale, 270,912 images), is a much larger, but imbalanced dataset containing 48 Hiragana characters and one Hiragana iteration mark.I implemented a simple cnn model on the dataset with Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy as loss function
